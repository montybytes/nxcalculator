## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The calculator is designed to feel at home on Nothing & CMF phones. I have tried (to the best of my abilities) to follow Nothing OS' visual language to create a minimal, clean, and distraction-free UI.

Functionally, it is close to a 1:1 experience with Google's Calculator, while matching the Nothing ecosystem’s design principles.
